# Code Quiz (working title)  (could just be permanent title) Proposal


## What is Code Quiz?

(Brief description of the game, why you're choosing to make it)

This game tests the player's knowledge of beginner foundational code.  
Is this a single player or multi player game?  I suspect this will be a single player game - game can log high scores on a leaderboard.  
Will be multiple choice probably.
Players accumulate points by answering questions correctly.
Questions will increase in difficulty .
Need to define how many questions will be in the code quiz.

Want this to look and feel like super early 80s games from sierra--specifically Kings Quest--the very first one from '83/'84.
sir graham is on a quest for knowledge (and more importantly, correct effing syntax).

the why-i'm building this mainly for me.  as a study tool.  

## Wireframe



(Your wireframes go here. Preferably two or more)

## Initial thoughts on game structure

(Write out what challenges you expect to encounter, or ideas you want to come up with)

## Phases of Completion

(The steps or phases you expect to go through, and the tasks that you'll need to accomplish to reach each step. These should resemble the acceptance criteria we were working through earlier.)

## Links and Resources

(Anything you've looked up so far or are thinking about using.)
