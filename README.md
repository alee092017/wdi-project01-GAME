# "Code: the quest for syntax" Proposal

## What is Code Quiz?

(Brief description of the game, why you're choosing to make it)

This game tests the player's knowledge of beginner foundational code.  
Is this a single player or multi player game?  I suspect this will be a single player game - game can log high scores on a leaderboard.  
Will be multiple choice probably.
Players accumulate points by answering questions correctly.
Questions will increase in difficulty .
Need to define how many questions will be in the code quiz.

Want this to look and feel like super early 80s games from sierra--specifically Kings Quest--the very first one from '83/'84--8-bit looking graphics.  See below 
sir graham is on a quest for knowledge (and more importantly, correct effing syntax).

the why-i'm building this mainly for me.  as a study tool.  

## Wireframe

(Your wireframes go here. Preferably two or more)
Sorry, these aren't wireframes, they're just swipes but there's not going to be that much navigation-

Quiz questions should appear like this with the letters typing out on the screen

another example

instructors will switch out depending on question/subject area

questions typed out in an 8 bit font

## Initial thoughts on game structure

(Write out what challenges you expect to encounter, or ideas you want to come up with)

Major challenge-right now I fully suck at all things WDI so completion in a few days will be an uphill battle.

This will not be very graphics heavy...the background might change a few times.
1.  I will need some quiz questions: Easy, Medium, Difficult
2.  I would love to be able to code in 'study mode' so that it could actually function as a study tool to help the wdi students get           practice in coding--again, I seem to understand (most of) the concepts but need a lot more practice/drills for everything.
3.  Cheat sheet.  I was going to do this anyway -- a quick reference guide of common mistakes/things forgotten 
    ie--interpolation--fng BACKTICKS.  
4.  I'll need to animate the typing of words on the screen

## Phases of Completion
(The steps or phases you expect to go through, and the tasks that you'll need to accomplish to reach each step. These should resemble the acceptance criteria we were working through earlier.)

1.  real wireframes and whiteboarding
  1a. inventory of the tiny pieces building blocks that need to be completed in order to have a functioning quiz
  1b. all all logic thought through--ie scoring, levels?  or just roulette questions and indicate if they're easy medium difficult, points t/b adjusted commensurate w/level
3.  user story
2.  assets gathering or creation--mainly graphics and questions
 Â  Â  2b.  volunteers to submit questions?  pref instructors?  or whoever is submitting pull requests first for homeworks hours before it's actually due. ðŸ˜‘
3. Â then phases of code..to be detailed once the whiteboarding/wireframing is done

## Links and Resources
(Anything you've looked up so far or are thinking about using.)
used the links and swipes for wireframes....but googled
where is the sierra archive?  does anyone know what happened to it?
