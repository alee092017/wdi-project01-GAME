# "Code: the quest for syntax" User Story
## What happens when & where

* When the game opens User sees the classroom.
    * Text on the screen welcomes the user to the game and explains what the game is about
    * And __how the game is scored__.
        * Level 1-Questions answered correctly earn 1 point
        * Level 2-Questions answered correctly earn 2 points 
        * Level 3-Questions answered correctly early 3 points
    * 3 incorrect answers and you must start over (or you have 3 lives and after you lose your 3 lives you're done?  figure out how to code that)
    * 
    * The user will be Sir Graham
        *  For the leaderboard they can enter their name....until then the user is **Sir fucking Graham!**
    * I'll come up with a completely plausible reason why Sir Graham needs to learn coding syntax for HTML, CSS, and Javascript
    * The game will ask the user if they're ready to being--Yes or No (review instructions)
    * Game will explain the GA instructors:
         *  Jen will ask the HTML Questions
         *  Roy will ask the CSS Questions
         *  Moss will ask the JS Questions
         *  Richmond will announce when the user has reached the limit for incorrect questions by creepily announcing Sir Graham's quest failure and subsequent death-Richmond will stab Sir Graham with the overscale GA Pencil.
*Game Start
   *  Game will start with an HTML question that will type onto the screen
   *  Multiple choice answers will also type onto the screen
   *  User selects A, B, C, D 
   *  Answer types out onto the screen whether they are right or wrong.
   *  Scoreboard to right of screen changing accordingly to keep track of screen
*  Game Play
   *  Questions rotate between HTML, CSS, JS
   *  Correct questions earn points
   *  No. of Incorrect questions are tracked until Sir Graham dies.
*  Game End
   *  I have no idea....answer # of questions correctly where # is determined later?  
   *  Or Sir Graham Death

## Feedback from Instructor Panel:
   1.  Make sure the logic of what is holding the questions is thought through (object array)
   2.  Make the classroom the only setting
   3.  Replace all animation with buttons first.
      1.  Do animation AFTER all button functionality works
   4.  __DO GRAPHICS LAST__ (of course)
   5.  all above should be achievable given time allowed and skill level (we shall see, people....we shall see ðŸ˜‘)
